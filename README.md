## Hi 👋 My name is Jana 🫡

I live in the Southwest of Germany and when I'm not smashing weights in the gym I love to architect solutions in AWS making my and the customers lives easier. 👩‍💻

### 🚀 My AWS Journey 
My computer science journey started as an On-Premise System Administrator over the time developing to an AWS Architect. As I know both the "old" and "new" world, I know common pain points in architectures and being able to provide solutions to solve them and making them not even more efficient but also cheaper!

### 👾 What I do 
I enjoy to learn and as the AWS portfolio is evolving all the time, I also try to stay up to date by getting certified and checking out newly launched products and services.
If you want to lift your environment either to the cloud or want to leverage your already migrated environment to use more of the cloud services, hit me up or check out Public Cloud Group GmbH!
